# dna-sequence-analysis
In this project, we use the BioPython library to manipulate and analyse DNA sequence data. DNA, the carrier of genetic information, consists of nucleotidesâ€”adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Understanding DNA sequence characteristics is vital across genetic research, disease diagnosis, drug development, and evolutionary studies.

The project involves various analyses, starting with fundamental properties like nucleotide composition and GC content. These provide insights into nucleotide distribution and DNA stability. Advanced analyses include Tri-nucleotide compositions (Tri-mer), protein synthesis simulation, protein analysis, and Codon Usage Analysis.
